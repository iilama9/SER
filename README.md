In this project, A speech emotion identification system will develop,
which aims to better identify the emotions using machine learning techniques.
Multiple machine learning algorithms (Support vector machine. K Nearest Neighbor and Random Forest) over various types of features will be used. 
The evaluation will be made to select the optimal algorithm.
